Hey there !

My name is Aditya Shidhaye and I'm a software developer.
I was born in India, grew up in Muscat (Oman) and currently living in Nasik (India).

I got my degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering at IIIT - Delhi.

I recently developed an interest in purely functional programming.
At work I use with Java and in my free time I explore Haskell.
